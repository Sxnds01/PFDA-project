    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "It is widely known that alcohol, especially consumed in excess is bad for your health. The WHO reported that 2.6 million people died in 2019 due to alcohol related illnesses and that the worldwide total consumption of alcohol is equal to 5.5 litres of pure alcohol per person of age 15 years and older [1]. In Ireland, the per-capita alcohol consumption (11.3 recorded in 2016) is greater than the whole European region (9.8 in 2016) [2]. And of this nearly 40% participating in heavy episodic drinking which is six standard drinks or more in a single drinking session [2]. This is most common amongst men between 15 upto 34 years particularly from lower socio-economic groups compared to women in the same age range. Despite this high level of hazardous drinking, majority of Irish drinkers would consider themselves light to moderate drinkers which shows the disconnect between what the general public think is considered hazardous drinking and what it actually is [3]. The WHO estimates that alcohol harm costs the country â‚¬12 billion every year [4] which is an enormous amount of money to spend every year for something that is preventable. In an effort to reduce this spending, the government have introduced legislation via the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018. Since this Act was introduced there have been stricter laws regarding the pricing and advertising of alcohol as well as the separating of it in grocery shops and restrictions on times it can be sold throughout the week in shops and in pubs and nightclubs [5]. There is still more to come with stricter health labels due to come in 2026 [6]. This is all in attempt to reduce the overall consumption of alcohol in the country which has may be successful as the consumption of alcohol has been declining considerably since 2018.\n",
